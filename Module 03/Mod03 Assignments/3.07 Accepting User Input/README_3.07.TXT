<+s>    I found this assignment easy. To make things interesting, I used an integer array in
        combination with a for loop to allow the user to input any number of test scores that
        the program would then find the average and total of.
<-s>    When I started coding the program, I forgot to import java.util.Scanner which led to
        errors later on. (This didn't actually happen, but I can't think of anything I really did
        wrong and I'm tired of talking about increasing my typing speed which is already 100WPM).

In the future:  I will make sure to check I have imported the necessary libraries for various objects
                before using them in my code.
