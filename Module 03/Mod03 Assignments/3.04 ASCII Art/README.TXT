/***************************** P M R ***********************************************************
<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used the '\n' escape sequence to keep each row of ASCII
        characters on a different line while staying within the guidelines of the project which
        stated I couldn't use Java's println() function.
<-s>    Overall, I think I didn't do anything particularily bad on this assignment. I could have
        made better ASCII art though :P.

In the future:  I will work to hone my ASCII art skills, so that if I am ever faced with another
                ASCII art assignment I can paint the console like Picasso.
