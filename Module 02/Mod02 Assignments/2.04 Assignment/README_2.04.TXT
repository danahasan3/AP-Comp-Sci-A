<+s>    I have gotten more used to the way braces work in this IDE, so I am able to program at
        a much faster rate.
<-s>    I didn't notice myself doing anything particularily wrong over the course of this
        assignment. One way I could improve though is to continue to improve my typing speed,
        so that I can start coding even faster.
***********************************************************************************************/

In the future:  I'll continue to regularily program, so that I can build muscle memory and type
                faster. This will allow me to program even more efficiently.
