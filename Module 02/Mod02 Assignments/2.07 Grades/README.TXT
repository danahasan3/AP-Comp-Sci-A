<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I noticed that there was a lot of repetition every time
        a test score was added, so I created a function that does the whole update for me. This
        allowed me to shorten the length of the code by a lot, and make it more readable.
<-s>    I didn't notice myself doing anything wrong during this assignment. As I mentioned before
        I need to continue to improve my typing speed, so that I can program more efficiently.

In the future:  I will continue to program daily, so that I can develop muscle memory, type
                faster, and program more efficiently.
