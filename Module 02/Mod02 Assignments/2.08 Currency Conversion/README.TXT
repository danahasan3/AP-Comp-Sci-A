<+s>    I found this assignment easy. The program compiled and ran without errors on my first try.
<-s>    I didn't notice myself doing anything wrong during this assignment. As I mentioned in
        previous assignments, I need to continue to improve my typing speed, so that I can program 
        more efficiently.

Note:   I used https://www.xe.com/ to get exchange rates for the countries I used in this program.

In the future:  I will continue to program daily, so that I can develop muscle memory, type
                faster, and program more efficiently.
