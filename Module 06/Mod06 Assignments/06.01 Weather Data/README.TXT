/***************************** P M R ***********************************************************
<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used various tools such as terniary operators, printf
        statements, and the String.format() function to create an organized Weather Data table.
        I also created my own functions to add functionality that the printf function didn't give
        by itself (as far as I know) such as allowing for center aligned text and the printing of
        repeated characters.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
