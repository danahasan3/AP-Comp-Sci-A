<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I created a Hurricane class that allowed me to organize all
        my data. I also used the printCenter and printRepeated functions I created in the previous
        program to easily display data in a way that looks nice. I also created functions for max
        and min with overloaders for integers and doubles. I used terniary operators to write the
        max and min functions using only one line. I used an ArrayList to store my data so that
        I didn't have to declare the size of the array prior to reading the data. I also used
        System.err to print errors to the screen when users gave invalid year ranges.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
