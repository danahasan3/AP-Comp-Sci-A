<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used the IgnoreCase of all the comparison to ensure that
        the user could select options in both lowercase and uppercase. I also used the 
        System.err.println() function to print errors to the console if the user inputted
        a nonexistant option.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
