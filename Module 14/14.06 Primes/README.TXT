<+s>    I found this assignment easy. For each number within the range provided, I ran a for loop
        running from 2 to the square root of that number to check if that number had any factors.
        If it didn't then I added it to an ArrayList. By the end of the loop the ArrayList had
        every prime within the provided range.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
