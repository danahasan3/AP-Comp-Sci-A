<+s>    I found this assignment easy. After finishing the assignment I thought it would be
        interesting to apply the program I just made to draw circles on the console, so I
        used double for loops and the same idea I used in the assignment to draw some circle
        pixel art on the screen.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
