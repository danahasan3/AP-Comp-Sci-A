<+s>    I found this assignment easy. The assignment gave a complicated version of the formula
        for calculating weight on various planets, so I created a simpler version. The assignment
        version first calculated the mass in grams and then used that value to calculate the weight
        on the planets. I directly calculated the weight of the individual on the planets by using
        the formula W_planet = W_earth * (SG_planet/SG_earth).
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
