<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I had actually originally done the Hurricanes project
        using Object-Oriented Programming, so this assignment was easy as I just needed to
        tweak some parts of the code to match the rubric

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
