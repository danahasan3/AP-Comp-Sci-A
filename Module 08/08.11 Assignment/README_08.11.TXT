<+s>    I found this assignment easy. Throughout my code I used terniary operators to make my
        code more concise, and I used multi-line statements to make my code more readable. I
        also used javadoc comments to add documentation for my code.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
