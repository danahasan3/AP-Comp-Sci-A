<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used Math.Random() to randomize the initialization
        parameters of all the objects in my array. I also used terniary operators to create
        simple max / min functions to make the code in my main method cleaner.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
