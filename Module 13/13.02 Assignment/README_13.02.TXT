<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used the concept of overriding functions to make a custom
        toString() function for each class, and then in the GameTerrainTester class, I used an
        ArrayList of Terrains to make my code shorter.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
