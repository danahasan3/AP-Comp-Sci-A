<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used switch case statements and terniary operators to
        make the code more concise and organized. I also used break and continue statements to
        gain greater control over my while loop.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
