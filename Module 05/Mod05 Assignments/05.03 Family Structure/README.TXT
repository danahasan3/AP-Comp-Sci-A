<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used Java's printf functions to print the values of the
        various percentages using only 2 decimal places. This kept the output concise and readable.
<-s>    When I tried to import the necessary modules for this program, I accidentally typed
        "import java.util.File" instead of "import java.io.File". I've also been programming in
        Python a lot lately, so I caught myself declaring variables without the variable type at
        times.

In the future:  I should remember that the File module comes under the java.io directory. I should
                also keep track of the differences between Java and other languages while programming
                with it.
