<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I used while loops with the condition set to true in various
        places, so that I could have finer control over when the loop ended by using java's break
        functionality.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
