<+s>    I found this assignment fairly easy. I noticed for the header we were required to print
        various characters a large amount of times, so I created a function that utilized a for
        loop to automate this process for me.
<-s>    Since I'm used to more sophisticated IDE's that automatically complete braces that you
        add, I am often finding myself only placing the first brace of a pair by accident.

In the future:  I'll keep practicing with this IDE, so that I can get used to completing braces
                when I start them. This will allow me to write code much more efficiently.
