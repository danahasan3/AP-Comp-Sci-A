<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I followed the instructions and my code worked as expected
        on the first try. I used a for-each loop to loop through the ArrayList of ocurses and
        make my code more readable.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
