/***************************** P M R ***********************************************************
<+s>    I found this assignment easy. I followed the instructions and my code worked as expected
        on the first try. I used a for-each loop to loop through the ArrayList of courses and
        make my code more readable. I also used the instanceof keyword to make it easier to access
        the nth element in the list of a specific type.
<-s>    I don't think I did anything wrong in this assignment.

In the future:  I will continue to practice programming daily to ensure that I can continue to
                do well on these assignments and get a 5 on the AP Exam.
